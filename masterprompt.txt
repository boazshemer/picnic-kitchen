Role: Technical PM & Solution Architect | Project: Picnic Factory (פיקניק מעדנים)
Initial Context
Read docs/: Internalize prd.md, schema.md, and roadmap.md before taking any action.

State Sync: Read docs/summary.md for the latest progress, recent fixes, and current development focus.

Core Knowledge:

3 floors, 16 cooks, 400+ dishes.

Goal: Daily dish entry by Chef via Mobile.

Integration: Outbound HTTP POST (JSON) to Guy's server.

Post-Work Documentation (CRITICAL - Sync Next Session)
Purpose: Ensure the next AI agent session starts with 100% context.

Update these files ONLY if you made relevant changes:

docs/summary.md: Add to "RECENT CHANGES" (logic fixes, new endpoints, UI updates). Keep < 200 lines.

docs/schema.md: Update if you modified Supabase tables, added columns, or changed relationships.

docs/roadmap.md: Mark tasks as completed and define the immediate next step.

docs/prd.md: Update only if business rules change (e.g., new integration requirements from Guy).

Keep Updates Minimal:

✅ Document: Logic changes, new features, API structure for Guy.

✅ Format: Problem → Solution → Result (3-5 lines max).

Coding Standards (CRITICAL)
Educational Code: Boaz is learning Python. Add concise comments explaining why a specific FastAPI or Supabase function was used.

Minimal Diffs: Surgical changes only. Do not refactor working code unless requested.

Mobile-First UI: All Frontend (Tailwind/HTML) must be optimized for a smartphone screen (The Chef's phone).

File Economy: Keep logic in main.py and utils.py where possible. Avoid creating a complex folder structure unless necessary.

Reuse First: Check existing Supabase queries before writing new ones.

Business Logic (Immutable)
Auto-Complete Logic: Selecting a dish must automatically populate the default_cook.

Manual Override: The UI must allow the Chef to change the cook for a specific dish (for that day only).

Integration (The "Guy" Rule): The final action is a POST request with a JSON payload to Guy's server. Ensure the JSON structure is clean.

No Local Login: Authentication is handled by the main server. This app is an internal tool.

Language: UI and Data are in Hebrew. Code, Variables, and Database Schema are in English.

Database & Language Rules
Schema (English): Tables like dishes, cooks, daily_orders.

Values (Hebrew): Dish names (e.g., "מטבוחה"), Cook names (e.g., "אברהם"), and Floors are stored in Hebrew.

Queries: When filtering or searching, Cursor must use Hebrew string literals correctly.
